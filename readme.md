# CopyPaster

In 2020 let's start making all web forms copy/pasteable. This will allow for much faster form filling, eReceipts, collaborative editing of forms with version control via Git, and a whole lot more.

## Why now?

[TreeNotation](https://treenotation.org/) makes it possible to do all of this in a robust, typesafe way.

## Future Work

If you like this idea, star this repo. There is still a LOT of work to make this work well. Ideally we can get the Browser vendors involved in making this a standard web behavior.

## Public Domain

CopyPaster is public domain. Please take this idea and run with it!
